        Optional: copies pre-compiled boot images for the D0 and M0 harts
        into the output images directory. These cannot be built with this
        buildroot config as they require a different tool chain. See 
        https://github.com/bouffalolab/bl808_linux/ for instructions on 
        how to build these manaully.
